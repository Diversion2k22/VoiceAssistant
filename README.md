# VoiceAssistant
It's a voice assistant made from python and few of its modules. It can speak and take voice orders but may not able to excute them properly because it's in a very initial stage right now. It can open google, youtube, in computer apps(The one which path is written can be modified), play music(I have not added this as i dont have any music library in my system) and can serch wikipedia. It has high scope for its further development.

To work with program properly Change the pc location of the installed apps according to your own benefits.

Before Running the program INSTALL this in your Terminal ans set the path : 
pip install wikipedia
pip install webbrowser
pip install speechRecognition
pip install pyttsx3
pip install datetime

You can Change the voice of the assistant according to your choice by changing the command in line 15:
voice[0] for Male
voice[1] for femele
It is currently in female
